# Structural Analysis

Analyze code organization, module structure, and architectural patterns.

## Tools

Use these LSP tools to analyze code structure.

| Required              | Enhanced |
| --------------------- | -------- |
| `get_folding_ranges`  |          |
| `get_semantic_tokens` |          |
| `get_symbols`         |          |

## Data to Collect

Gather structural metrics and organization patterns.

- Total symbol count (functions, classes, interfaces, etc.)
- Symbol distribution per file
- Class/interface definitions count
- Function/method complexity indicators
- Code folding structure (nesting depth)
- Module organization patterns

## Deliverables

- Symbol distribution report (total count, breakdown by type)
- Per-file symbol analysis (which files are most complex)
- Nesting depth metrics (average, maximum, files exceeding thresholds)
- Module organization assessment (patterns identified, coupling analysis)
