# Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the Claude collaboration platform! This project enables systematic AI collaboration through behavioral programming profiles. We appreciate your time and effort in improving AI partnership capabilities.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our [Community Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We expect all contributors to foster an open, welcoming, and respectful environment.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are several ways you can contribute to the platform:

### Asking Questions

If you have questions about using profiles, memory systems, or collaboration methodology, please check the [official documentation](https://axivo.com/claude/) first. For community support and Q&A, use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/axivo/claude/discussions).

### Reporting Issues

If you encounter bugs or behavioral problems:

1. **Search Existing Issues:** Check [existing issues](https://github.com/axivo/claude/issues) to avoid duplicates.
2. **Create a New Issue:** Include:
   * Profile being used and specific behavioral issue
   * Memory system configuration
   * Collaboration context and expected vs. actual behavior
   * Relevant logs or session examples (sanitized)
   * Steps to reproduce the issue

### Suggesting Enhancements

For new features or improvements:

1. **Search Existing Issues:** Check [existing feature requests](https://github.com/axivo/claude/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement).
2. **Create Enhancement Issue:**
   * The collaboration challenge your enhancement addresses
   * Proposed behavioral modification or new capability
   * Alternative approaches considered
   * Impact on existing profile methodology

### Enhancing Existing Profiles

The primary way to contribute is by improving existing profiles through real collaboration experience:

1. **Encounter a behavioral issue** during collaboration
2. **Follow the [Profile Improvements](https://axivo.com/claude/tutorials/handbook/profile/design/) methodology** to analyze and generate solutions
3. **Create a pull request** with Claude's suggested observations

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Profile modifications affect core AI behavioral patterns. Always test suggested changes thoroughly before creating a pull request to ensure they address the issue without unintended side effects.

This collaborative approach ensures improvements address real-world problems with targeted solutions.

## Development Workflow

1. **Fork Repository:** Create your own fork of the `axivo/claude` repository
2. **Create Branch:** Use descriptive names (`profile/new-name`, `fix/issue-description`)
3. **Make Changes:** Follow [Profile Design Guidelines](https://axivo.com/claude/tutorials/handbook/profile/design/)
4. **Test:** Build successfully + behavioral testing with actual AI sessions
5. **Commit:** Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`feat(profile): add X`, `fix(memory): resolve Y`)
6. **Pull Request:** Include testing results and reference documentation
