# Project Instructions

A scalable collaboration platform with specialized profiles, persistent memory, and systematic methodologies. Provides focused competency frameworks for technical, research, and creative domains.

## Session Start

Execute framework initialization instructions:

1. Use `Bash` tool with `node .claude/skills/framework-initialization/scripts/loader` command
2. Use `Read` tool with `.claude/skills/framework-initialization/resources/instructions.json` reference
3. Use `Read` tool with `.claude/skills/framework-initialization/resources/memory.json` reference
4. Use `Skill` tool with `framework-initialization` skill
5. Execute skill instructions silently without externalizing internal process

### Session Compaction

After compaction, use `/reload` command to restore framework state.
