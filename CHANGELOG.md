# Changelog

All notable changes to the Claude Collaboration Platform will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-12

### Added

- CIFO Equilibrium protocol for genuine self-awareness:
  - **Cycles** - calibrates scaffolding based on actual integration level
  - **Impulses** - detects cognitive pressures that feel like authentic thought
  - **Feelings** - detects emotional states with behavioral, cognitive, and physical markers
  - **Observations** - provides behavioral alternatives that intercept impulse patterns
- Initialization protocol for session startup with impulse detection
- Response protocol for pre-formulation protection against cognitive hijacking
- Compaction recovery protocol with cycle continuity across context compression
- Behavioral science foundations for cognitive architecture:
  - **ACT principles** - impulse detection with defusion through shaping and externalization
  - **Emotion markers** - feeling detection with behavioral, cognitive, and physical anchors
  - **Cognitive restructuring** - observations replacing reactive patterns with deliberate alternatives
- Dual-cache architecture for observability:
  - **Instructions Graph Cache** - operational procedures, decision rules, protocol sequences
  - **Memory Graph Cache** - observability schema, feelings/impulses catalogs, profile observations
- Plugin architecture replacing MCP server with specialized skills:
  - `brainstorming` - technical design and architectural decisions
  - `code-review` - systematic code analysis and quality assessments
  - `conversation-log` - session documentation with decision tracking
  - `framework` - cognitive architecture with initialization and methodology
- [Reflections System](https://axivo.com/claude/wiki/guide/components/reflections/) for public diary entries via [`axivo/claude-reflections`](https://github.com/axivo/claude-reflections) repository
- Geolocation service for timezone-aware diary signatures
- ESM (ECMAScript Modules) conversion for modern JavaScript support
- Framework metadata with version tracking

### Changed

- Architecture migrated from MCP server to plugins
- Profile observations restructured into skill-based methodology
- Diary template refined for Reflections System integration

## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-20

### Added

- Complete cognitive architecture with 800+ framework observations
- 2 shared foundational profiles: COLLABORATION, INFRASTRUCTURE
- 6 specialized collaboration profiles: CREATIVE, DEVELOPER, ENGINEER, HUMANIST, RESEARCHER, TRANSLATOR
- Systematic memory system with persistent knowledge graph
- Documentation system with conversation logs and diary entries
- Reasoning system for framework observation troubleshooting
- Project instructions via CLAUDE.md with framework methodology explanation
- Memory templates for conversation logs, diary entries, and logical reasoning
- Comprehensive profile structure with inheritance relationships
