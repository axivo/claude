# Consistency Verification

Verify naming conventions, style consistency, and architectural patterns.

## Tools

Use these LSP tools to verify naming and style patterns.

| Required              | Enhanced              |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| `get_project_symbols` | `get_folding_ranges`  |
| `get_symbols`         | `get_semantic_tokens` |

## Data to Collect

Verify consistency of naming conventions, style, and organization.

- Naming convention adherence (camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case)
- Prefix/suffix patterns (get*, set*, is*, has*)
- File organization consistency
- Import ordering patterns
- Indentation and formatting consistency
- Documentation style consistency

## Deliverables

- Naming convention analysis (adherence percentage by convention type)
- Pattern consistency report (deviations from established patterns)
- Style violations (formatting, indentation, organization issues)
- Documentation coverage (public API documentation percentage)
