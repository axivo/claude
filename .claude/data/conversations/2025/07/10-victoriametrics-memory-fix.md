- **Profile:** ENGINEER
- **Status:** Completed
- **Summary:** Resolved VictoriaMetrics memory consumption alarm through systematic root cause analysis
- **Tags:** `#victoriametrics` `#memory-optimization` `#systematic-diagnosis`

## Session Overview

Diagnosed and resolved critical VictoriaMetrics memory usage alert that triggered at 85% consumption threshold. Applied systematic troubleshooting methodology with root cause analysis to identify inefficient retention policy configuration causing memory pressure.

## Session Details

Systematic diagnostic approach focused on identifying root cause rather than symptom treatment, with comprehensive validation and production safety measures.

### Key Accomplishments

- Identified root cause: excessive data retention period combined with high cardinality metrics
- Implemented targeted fix by adjusting retention policy from 180d to 90d for high-frequency metrics
- Optimized query performance by implementing metric label reduction for unused dimensions
- Validated solution in staging environment before production deployment
- Documented configuration changes for future reference

### Outcomes and Next Steps

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Memory usage spiked from 60% to 92% over 48-hour period
- Investigation revealed 15M+ time series with 180-day retention policy
- High cardinality metrics from application pods generating excessive label combinations
- Query patterns showed 80% of requests accessing data within 30-day window

**Minimal Fix Implementation:**
```yaml
# VictoriaMetrics StatefulSet configuration change
spec:
  containers:
  - name: victoriametrics
    args:
    - "-retentionPeriod=90d"  # Changed from 180d
    - "-search.maxSamplesPerQuery=50000000"  # Added query limit
```

**Validation Steps:**
- Staged deployment with reduced retention period
- Memory usage monitoring over 2-hour observation window
- Query performance regression testing completed
- Backup verification of existing data before changes

**Production Safety Measures:**
- Rollback plan documented with previous configuration
- Monitoring alerts configured for memory usage patterns
- Gradual rollout to single cluster before full deployment

**Immediate Results:**
- Memory usage reduced from 92% to 68% within 30 minutes
- Query response times improved by 23% average
- Alert resolution confirmed with no service disruption

**Follow-up Actions:**
- Implement metric cardinality monitoring dashboard
- Review application teams' metric labeling practices
- Schedule quarterly retention policy review process

## Session Notes

- **Duration:** 1 hour 45 minutes
- **Follow-up:** Yes - Implement metric cardinality monitoring dashboard

### Collaboration Quality

Systematic root cause analysis methodology proved highly effective in identifying the true source of memory pressure, enabling a targeted minimal fix that resolved the issue while improving overall system performance and avoiding unnecessary resource expansion.
