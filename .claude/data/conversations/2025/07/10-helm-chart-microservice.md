# Helm Chart Development for Node.js Microservice

- **Date:** July 10, 2025
- **Time:** 6:00 PM EDT
- **Profile:** DEVELOPER
- **Summary:** Created production-ready Helm chart for user authentication microservice
- **Tags:** `#helm-charts` `#microservice-deployment` `#nodejs-backend`

## Session Overview

Developed a comprehensive Helm chart for the new user authentication microservice, implementing SOLID principles in chart structure and following clean configuration practices. Applied systematic approach to template organization and value management.

## Key Accomplishments

- Created modular Helm chart structure with separate templates for deployment, service, ingress, and configmap
- Implemented proper secret management using Kubernetes secrets with environment-specific values
- Applied SOLID principles to chart organization with single-responsibility templates
- Configured resource limits and requests following production safety guidelines
- Set up horizontal pod autoscaling with appropriate CPU and memory thresholds

## Details

**Chart Structure:**
- Deployment template with rolling update strategy and readiness/liveness probes
- Service configuration with ClusterIP for internal communication
- Ingress setup with TLS termination using cert-manager annotations
- ConfigMap for application configuration with environment variable injection
- Secret templates for database credentials and JWT signing keys

**Code Quality Practices:**
- Used meaningful variable names in values.yaml that express intent
- Avoided over-engineered solutions by keeping templates focused and readable
- Implemented proper error handling in template conditionals
- Organized imports and dependencies logically in Chart.yaml
- Removed unused template blocks and maintained clean formatting

**Validation Steps:**
- Dry-run deployment validation in development environment
- Helm lint passed with zero warnings
- Template rendering verification for all environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Security scan completed with no critical vulnerabilities

## Outcomes and Next Steps

**Completed:**
- Production-ready Helm chart with comprehensive documentation
- Multi-environment value files (dev, staging, production)
- CI/CD pipeline integration with automated testing

**Next Steps:**
- Deploy to staging environment for integration testing
- Performance testing with load scenarios
- Documentation update for team deployment procedures
